# Sentinel

Sentinel is a social networking platform that seeks to innovate while maintaining well-liked elements seen in most comparable platforms. Sentinel's fundamental concept is to provide an amazing user experience and make **every message count.** 

## How does Sentinel begin?

Sentinel was originally intended to be a straightforward science fair project on studying how social media functions. However, the research revealed intriguing facts that, when coupled with a stoking passion, spawned a challenge: building a social media for nothing, with few resources, using a single environment, and challenging a single developer to the limits of his abilities

## Which technologies is Sentinel using?

- Due to its java-like syntax and easy learning curve, **Dart is used as the primary programming language.**
- **Flutter**, chosen as the primary framework for its adaptability.
- **Firebase**, for the backend due to being part of Google's ecosystem. It includes the following products:
  - Auth
  - Firestore
  - 2FA
  - Analytics
  - CloudOTP

## Contributing

Sentinel is not a professional project an is not intended to be mantained as a popular social media in a near future. The reader is persuaded to expand the project further so that they can showcase their talents on stage in true Sentinel fashion.

## What software was used during the process?

- [Microsoft Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Figma](https://www.figma.com/)

## Understanding the Code

This project is ideal for beginning programmers because it is built on the foundation of other developers' works and personal expertise (mostly on the Frontend). Here are some videos and websites that can inspire you or help you better understand Sentinel or create your own project to enter the Dart/Flutter universe.
